        <p>In those days land resources were monopolised and in the stanglehold of few powerful upper caste feudal lords. They grabbed lands from the lower status people. This situation had even lead to many struggles by the exploited. Blood Shed, gang rapes, sexual assault and institutional harasment were common then. But Chakali Ilamma was determined to take 40 acres of land for lease from Kondala Rao, a landlord and she started to cultivate it. This comes as a shock and insult to upper caste feudal landlords and Nizam harassment because a Bahujan woman owned Land. She Patwari Verramanei Seshagiri, who was keeping records of Land ownership, tried to cover Ilamma to give up her work on her land and work in his land along with her family which was in form of slavery. She was aware that landlords would come up to grab her land through persistence physical attacks and try to cut her crop away. Chakali Ilamma told them This is my land, this is my crop. Who is this Dora to take away my land and crop? It is only possible for you when i die. A bahujan woman saying it to their faces was a brave move. This anguished them the most. Visnoor Deshmukh (a Dora) Ramachandra Reddy filed a false case against Chakali Ilamma and her family, her husband and sons arrested. Ilamma took the case to the court and the verdict came in her favour. Then Deshmukh falsely used his power to transfer Ilammas Land in his name. He asked his servants to collect all the crop from Ilammas land. Ilamma with the help of Andhra Sabha members had already cut the crop and hid it safely. The Deshmukh wanted to desprive her economically. He passed an order to burn her house down. The patwaris servants beat her husband and gang raped her daughter. Chakali Ilamma taking a revenge destroyed the Patwaris house and set up a corn field on the same land. With Ilammas courage and fight, CPI was able to attack the landlords and the upper castes. The story of Chakali Ilamma reflects how land was monopolised by upper caste feudal lords and her story is the celebration of a Bahujan Womans resistance. Her fight was also for gender equality and equality within women. She questioned and stood against upper caste women who equally commanding the lower caste women.
